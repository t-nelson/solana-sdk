//! Collection of all runtime features.
//!
//! Steps to add a new feature are outlined below. Note that these steps only cover
//! the process of getting a feature into the core Solana code.
//! - For features that are unambiguously good (ie bug fixes), these steps are sufficient.
//! - For features that should go up for community vote (ie fee structure changes), more
//!   information on the additional steps to follow can be found at:
//!   <https://spl.solana.com/feature-proposal#feature-proposal-life-cycle>
//!
//! 1. Generate a new keypair with `solana-keygen new --outfile feature.json --no-passphrase`
//!    - Keypairs should be held by core contributors only. If you're a non-core contributor going
//!      through these steps, the PR process will facilitate a keypair holder being picked. That
//!      person will generate the keypair, provide pubkey for PR, and ultimately enable the feature.
//! 2. Add a public module for the feature, specifying keypair pubkey as the id with
//!    `solana_pubkey::declare_id!()` within the module.
//!    Additionally, add an entry to `FEATURE_NAMES` map.
//! 3. Add desired logic to check for and switch on feature availability.
//!
//! For more information on how features are picked up, see comments for `Feature`.
